## ⚠️ Caution

CobraStore currently runs on a mock backend, [MockBee](https://mockbee.netlify.app/). So, everytime the page reloads a new instance of the server starts. What this means is, data won't persist on reloading the page. However, all other functionality works flawlessly like a real backend.

You can test this, by logging in or signing up then adding a few items to your cart and wishlist then logging out and again repeating the process using different credentials. Now, when you'll login using the 1st credentials you'll notice that the cart and wishlist shows the data as expected. Repeat the same for 2nd credentials and you'll see it is true for this case also. However, remember to not reload at any point during the process as that will start a new instance of the server.
